Ok sent them an email saying you guys need to have usa currency so people know what they are spending because i was way off. I went through glam shop & told them the whole story through email & they basically said you got the eyeshadows what is the problem? I called UPS after glam shop didn't not give a crap & UPS keeps asking me what happened without doing anything about the situation they were at fault for.
